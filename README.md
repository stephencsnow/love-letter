# Love Letter

Prototype [Love Letter](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Letter_(card_game)>) clone built using [Hathora](https://hathora.dev/).

Accessible at https://love-letter-hathora.surge.sh/

## Running locally

See Hathora docs for more details, but in a few steps(node v16.12.0+ required):

```sh
npm install -g hathora
hathora dev
```

Then open localhost:3000 in your browser. Can open up additional windows for more users.

## Todo

- More verbose event logging.
- Proper Game vs Round separation
- Client UI
